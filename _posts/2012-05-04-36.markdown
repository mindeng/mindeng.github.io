SQLite 3.7.11 includes documented support for the FTS4 content option. This feature has actually been in the code since version 3.7.9 but is only now considered to be officially supported.

To enable this feature, use the following command to compile the amalgamation source code:

    cc sqlite3.c shell.c -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4 -lpthread -ldl -o sqlite3

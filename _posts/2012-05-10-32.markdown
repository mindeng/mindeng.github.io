1. Download the appropriate version of install\_flash_player.tar.gz archive from the [official website](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/)

1. Unpack the downloaded file, and copy the file libflashplayer.so into the Chrome plugins directory:

        sudo cp libflashplayer.so /opt/google/chrome/plugins/

   *Note* If the plugins directory is not existed, you should create it.

1. Open the address "chrome://plugins/" in your Chrome, if all goes well, you should see the flash plugin information like this::
  
        Flash - Version: 11.2 r202
        Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202

  Now the latest flash has been activated in you Chrome.

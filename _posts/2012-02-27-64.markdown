In Emacs, columns are called rectangles.

C-x r r
:  Copy rectangle to region.

C-x r i
:  Insert region.
    
C-x r k
:  Kill the text of the region-rectangle, saving its contents as the “last killed rectangle” (kill-rectangle). 

C-x r d
:  Delete the text of the region-rectangle (delete-rectangle). 

C-x r y
:  Yank the last killed rectangle with its upper left corner at point (yank-rectangle).
  
C-x r o
:  Insert blank space to fill the space of the region-rectangle (open-rectangle). This pushes the previous contents of the region-rectangle rightward.
    
`C-x r c`
:  Clear the region-rectangle by replacing all of its contents with spaces (clear-rectangle).
    
M-x delete-whitespace-rectangle
:  Delete whitespace in each of the lines on the specified rectangle, starting from the left edge column of the rectangle.
    
C-x r t string <RET>
:  Replace rectangle contents with string on each line (string-rectangle).
    
M-x string-insert-rectangle <RET> string <RET>
:  Insert string on each line of the rectangle.

If you suddenly encounter this error when try to build a Android app by using `ant` command:

    Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
    Build failed

Try this command to fix it:

    android update project --target 5 --path /path/to/android/project

target is the build target for your project. Run:

    android list target

to get a list of all available targets.

This error may occur when you try to go back to an old version of ADT.

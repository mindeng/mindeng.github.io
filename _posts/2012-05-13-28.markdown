* To see if a file is an immutable file:
      
        # lsattr filename
        ----i--------  filename

  The letter 'i' means it's a file with immutable attribute.

* To make a file immutable:

        # chattr +i filename

* To remove immutable attribute for a file:

        # chattr -i filename

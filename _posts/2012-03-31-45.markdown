Squid normally listens to port 3128, you can change it in `/etc/squid/squid.conf` like this:

```
http_port 60000
```

By default, squid will only accept http access from localhost, which is exactly what we what. If not so, you can change it like this:


```
http_access allow localhost
http_access deny all
```

On client, you can connect the proxy server like this:


```
ssh -CNf -L 8888:localhost:60000 username@your.squid.server
```

Now you can setup your browser to use localhost:8888 as your http proxy.

---------------------------

Using socks proxy:


```
ssh -CNf -D localhost:7777 user@server
```

如果想让内网其他机器共享该代理，可以加上 `-g` 选项。

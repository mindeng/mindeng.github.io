On some old system (e.g. Debian 5), you may encounter the below
problem when you use sshfs to mount a remote filesystem:

    fusermount: failed to open /dev/fuse: permission denied

Adding your user to the fuse group should solve the issue:

    sudo addgroup yourusername fuse

You should re-login to take effect.

1. Download python 2.7 source code from <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/Python-2.7.3.tar.bz2>

1. Decompress the source code, and run:

        ./configure
        make

1. You maybe encounter "modules were not found" errors, just install these packages:

        sudo apt-get build-dep python2.6 python-gdbm python-bsddb3 libgdbm-dev
